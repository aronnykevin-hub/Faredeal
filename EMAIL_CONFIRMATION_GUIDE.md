- Wrong email address used during signup

**Solution:**
Use Option 2 (Manual verification) or Option 3 (Disable email confirmation)

### Issue: Confirmation link doesn't work

**Solution:**
```javascript
// Run in browser console after clicking link:
console.log('Current URL:', window.location.href);

// If on error page, manually navigate to:
location.href = '/admin-login';
```

### Issue: Still can't login after confirmation

**Solution:**
```javascript
// Check user status in console:
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
console.log('User:', data.user);
console.log('Email confirmed:', data.user?.email_confirmed_at);
