# RLS (Row Level Security) - Complete Fix Summary

## 🔒 Security Issue Fixed
**Problem**: 45 tables in your Supabase database had RLS disabled, exposing them to unauthorized access via PostgREST API.

**Solution**: Enabled RLS on all tables and created role-based security policies.

---

## 📁 Files Created

### 1. `fix-all-rls-complete.sql` ⭐ **USE THIS ONE**
- **Complete solution for all 45 tables**
- Creates 4 helper functions
- Enables RLS on all tables
- Creates appropriate policies for each table type
- Includes verification queries
- **This is the main file to run**

### 2. `fix-admin-rls-clean.sql`
- Simple version for just admin_dashboard_metrics
- Good for learning/reference
- Superseded by the complete solution above

---

## 🎯 How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
3. Click **New Query**

### Step 2: Run the Complete Fix
1. Open `fix-all-rls-complete.sql`
2. **Copy the ENTIRE file** (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)
3. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
4. Click **Run** (or Ctrl+Enter)
5. Wait for completion (should take 5-10 seconds)

### Step 3: Verify Success
You should see a success message like:
```
✅ RLS SECURITY APPLIED TO ALL TABLES - COMPLETE!
✓ RLS enabled on 45+ tables
✓ 50+ security policies created
✓ 4 helper functions created
```

### Step 4: Check the Verification Queries
Two queries will run automatically:
1. **RLS Status Check** - Shows which tables have RLS enabled
2. **Policy Count** - Shows how many policies exist per table

## 🔐 Security Architecture

### Helper Functions Created
1. **`is_admin()`** - Checks if user is admin/super_admin
2. **`is_manager_or_admin()`** - Checks if user is manager or above
3. **`is_cashier_or_above()`** - Checks if user is cashier or above
4. **`is_supplier()`** - Checks if user is supplier

### Access Levels

#### 🔴 **Admin-Only Tables** (9 tables)
Only admins can access these:
- `admin_activity_log`
- `admin_dashboard_metrics`
- `admin_notifications`
- `admin_system_config` (public configs readable by all)

- `admin_error_logs`
- `system_settings`

#### 🟠 **Manager Tables** (13 tables)
Managers and admins can access:
- `manager_activity_log`
- `manager_daily_reports`

- `manager_team_members`
- `manager_employee_schedules`
- `manager_employee_attendance`
- `manager_stock_requests`
- `manager_sales_analysis`
- `manager_customer_complaints`
- `manager_alerts`

- `employee_attendance`
- `supplier_performance`

#### 🟡 **Cashier Tables** (7 tables)
Cashiers, managers, and admins can access:
- `cashier_profiles`
- `cashier_shifts`
- `cashier_transactions`
- `cashier_drawer_operations`
- `cashier_returns`
- `cashier_alerts`
- `cashier_activity_log`

#### 🟢 **Supplier Tables** (10 tables)
Suppliers see their own data, admins/managers see all:
- `supplier_profiles` - Suppliers see only their profile
- `supplier_products` - Suppliers can manage their products
- `purchase_orders` - Suppliers can view, only managers can create
- `supplier_deliveries` - Suppliers can manage their deliveries
- `supplier_invoices` - Suppliers can manage their invoices
- `supplier_payments` - Suppliers can view, only managers create
- `supplier_communications` - Bidirectional communication
- `supplier_alerts` - Managers create, suppliers see theirs
- `supplier_activity_log` - Suppliers log their actions

#### 🔵 **Inventory/Product Tables** (4 tables)
Mixed access levels:
- `categories` - All can read, managers+ can write
- `products` - All authenticated can read, managers+ can write
- `suppliers` - Manager and admin only (inventory suppliers table)
- `inventory` - All can read, cashiers+ can write

#### ⚪ **General Tables** (2 tables)
- `customers` - All authenticated can read, cashiers+ can write
- `order_items` - Cashiers+ only
- `notifications` - Users see their own, admins see all

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

### Test 1: As Admin
```sql
-- Should return: true
SELECT is_admin();

-- Should work (return data)
SELECT * FROM admin_dashboard_metrics LIMIT 1;
SELECT * FROM manager_daily_reports LIMIT 1;
SELECT * FROM cashier_transactions LIMIT 1;
```

### Test 2: As Manager
```sql
-- Should return: false, true
SELECT is_admin(), is_manager_or_admin();

-- Should work
SELECT * FROM manager_daily_reports LIMIT 1;
SELECT * FROM cashier_transactions LIMIT 1;

-- Should fail (no access)
SELECT * FROM admin_dashboard_metrics LIMIT 1;
```

### Test 3: As Cashier
```sql
-- Should return: false, false, true
SELECT is_admin(), is_manager_or_admin(), is_cashier_or_above();

-- Should work
SELECT * FROM cashier_transactions LIMIT 1;
SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 1;

-- Should fail (no access)
SELECT * FROM manager_daily_reports LIMIT 1;
SELECT * FROM admin_dashboard_metrics LIMIT 1;
```

### Test 4: As Supplier
```sql
-- Should return: false, true
SELECT is_supplier(), is_manager_or_admin();

-- Should work (only your own data)
SELECT * FROM supplier_products WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
SELECT * FROM supplier_invoices WHERE user_id = auth.uid();

-- Should fail (can't see other suppliers' data or admin tables)
SELECT * FROM admin_dashboard_metrics LIMIT 1;
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "RLS policy violation" errors in application

**Cause**: Your frontend might be using the wrong Supabase key or users don't have proper roles.

**Solution**:
1. Check that you're using the **anon key** or **authenticated user JWT** in frontend
2. Verify users have the correct role in `auth.users.raw_user_meta_data`
3. Check: `SELECT id, email, raw_user_meta_data->>'role' as role FROM auth.users;`

### Issue: Backend operations fail

**Cause**: If your backend uses the authenticated key instead of service_role key.

**Solution**:
- Backend should use **service_role key** which bypasses RLS
- Frontend should use **anon key** which enforces RLS

### Issue: Suppliers can't see their data

**Cause**: The `user_id` column might not match `auth.uid()`.

**Solution**:
Check the supplier table structure:
```sql
-- For supplier_profiles, supplier_products, etc.
SELECT * FROM supplier_profiles WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
```

### Issue: Function doesn't exist errors

**Cause**: Helper functions weren't created.

**Solution**:
Re-run the SQL script or manually create the functions (they're at the top of the file).

## 🆘 Need Help?

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check the Supabase Logs**: Dashboard > Logs > Postgres Logs
2. **Review Browser Console**: Look for RLS policy errors
3. **Test SQL Directly**: Run test queries in SQL Editor
4. **Check User Roles**: Verify `raw_user_meta_data` has correct roles
5. **Review Policies**: Run `SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'public';`
